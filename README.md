# Bullet-gambit
Bullet Gambit is a tense, stylized two-player duel that mixes classic Russian‑roulette risk with light tactical choices and whimsical presentation. Players sit across a virtual table, take turns, and decide whether to shoot themselves to get a item to improve your chance or shoot the opponent to end it quicker while a single bullet hides in a six-chamber cylinder. The game balances luck, timing, and limited item use to create short, dramatic rounds with clear visual feedback.
